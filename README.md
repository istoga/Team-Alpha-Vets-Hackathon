## Equine Therapy App

<em>Igniting Access to Equine Therapy for Veterans Nationwide </em>

### Problem Statement:

- ðŸš© Limited access to specialized therapy programs, such as equine therapy, hinders the mental health support available to veterans nationwide.
- ðŸš© Veterans outside Houston face significant challenges in accessing equine therapy services, as the availability of these programs is primarily concentrated in certain VA locations.
- ðŸš© Geographical barriers create disparities in the accessibility of equine therapy, denying many veterans the opportunity to benefit from this proven and effective form of treatment.
- ðŸš© Existing equine therapy resources are not widely accessible throughout the VA system, leading to a lack of support for veterans seeking holistic and comprehensive mental health care.

## Solution
